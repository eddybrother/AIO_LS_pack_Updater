## AIO_LS_pack_Updater üñ•Ô∏è

AIO_LS_pack_Updater is an homebrew for Nintendo Switch which update your cfw with the pack of [shadow2560](https://github.com/shadow2560/) by default but this can also be configured with a "AIO_LS_pack_Updater.ini" file placed in the "switch/AIO_LS_pack_Updater".

The app can also auto-update itself, aply some protection for Atmosphere to be able to connect to internet with your CFW, get some usful informations about the console, install a firmware and install the HBMenu forwarder witch include the last version of the HBLoader.

## Beta mode

This mode could be useful to test the new features of the pack and the app but this also could brake some functions and could be not backward compatible with the stable version so use it if you know what you're doing. Beta mode has his own config file if you want to customize some settings, see the "config" folder of the repository.

## Agressive clean function

This function can be used when updating the pack or the firmware if you have some modules not included in the pack or if you come from an other pack. The folders witch are deleted by this function could be configured with the file "switch/AIO_LS_pack_Updater/folders_to_delete.txt" and the files could be configured with the file "switch/AIO_LS_pack_Updater/files_to_delete.txt", see the "config" folder of the repository, be careful with these files cause they can brake all the SD if they're badly configured. If you use one of these custom files the agressive clean integrated into the homebrew will be disabled.

## Files keeping function

This function can be used during pack update. It is used to keep some files/folders during process update, for example to keep some configuration files. The files/folders can be configured with the "switch/AIO_LS_pack_Updater/files_to_keep.txt" (see the "configs" folder of this repository for an example), this file should contain one file or folder by line and the path of the file/folder to keep is indicated from the SD root; note also that one line of the file could be used to define more than one folder/file to delete cause only the first letters of the path indicated is compared during the program (for example a line containing the path "atmosphere/conf" will protect any files/folders starting with this path). Also note that if the file doesn't exist on the SD it will be copied even if it is listed in the config file, this function is only used to protect existing files on the SD.

This function is not used during agressive clean, the agressive clean will delete any files/folders configured for it without taking care of this function's settings. In short, agressive clean take priority over this function.

## Translate the project

You can translate the project but for now there are some limitations:
* You can't use special chars or accents
* Only supported language of Nintendo could be used, see [this page](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Settings_services#LanguageCode) for more infos.

You can see the french language file for example, it is located in "romfs/lng/fr.ini".

Here are some Rules to translate correctly the app:
* Name your file according to Nintendo's language code, with the ".ini" extension and place it to the "romfs/lng" folder of the project. Note that if you want to test the file without recompiling the project you can place the file to the "switch/AIO_LS_pack_Updater" folder and name it "translate.ini", if you do that this file has the priority on those placed in the "romfs/lng" folder.
* Include [language] text on top of the file, this is needed to start the translation structure.
* You can start a line with a ; to comment the line
* Don't touch the % char and the chars witch follow it until the next space, this is used to display some variables of the app.
* Don't use more lines than "26" for the main menu or you could brake the display of it.
* Don't use accents or special chars.
* Include every variables and don't add some new ones or the translation file will not work.
* If you get an error while using a translation file it could be caused by a too long string for a variable.

## How to build üèóÔ∏è

``sudo pacman -S switch-curl switch-zlib``  
``git clone https://github.com/shadow2560/AIO_LS_pack_Updater.git``  
``cd AIO_LS_pack_Updater``  
``cd amssu-rcm``
``make``
